# Lem-in
Ants! Ants everywhere!!!

Usage: ./lem-in < ant_farms_examples/test[number of test]

Project goal is to read the given ant-farm (kind of graph) and find the best possible ways to move all ants from start to end in the shortest amount of time and moves.

Short rules:

1. Each room can only contain one ant at a time

2. At each turn program displays the ants that moved

3. At each turn ant could be moved only once and through a tube (the room at the receiving end must be empty)

4. No traffic jams

5. Any non compliant or empty lines will automatically stop the ant farmâ€™s reading and program displays error message

6. In no way can your program quit in an unexpected manner (segfault, bus error, double free, etc)
